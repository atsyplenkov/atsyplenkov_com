Hello, my name is Anatoly Tsyplenkov

I'm currently works at the [Makkaveev Lab of Soil Erosion and Fluvial Processes](https://makkaveevlab.com), Lomonosov Moscow State University. I'm doing research in soil erosion and sediment transport using in-situ measurements as well as modelling. Projects range from small mountanious rivers to large scale catchments. I've just defended my PHD thesis in December 2019 on the topic of «*Suspended sediment load formation in the small mountain river basins: general patterns and regional features*». As part of my dissertation I have mastered a set of modern methods of soil erosion modeling, interpolation, machine learning and fingerprinting.

**Specific research topics include:**

* watershed hydrology
* sediment transport processes and geochemical fingerprinting
* river channel changes in response to disturbance events and climate change

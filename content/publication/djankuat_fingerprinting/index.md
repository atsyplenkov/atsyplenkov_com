abstract: The sediment dynamics of (peri-)glacial catchments can be highly variable and complex. Understanding these dynamics and their underlying causes is not only of interest from a scientific perspective but also required to address the practical problems with which they are often associated. In order to better understand the sediment dynamics of glaciated mountainous catchments, suspended sediment fluxes in the 9.1 km² Djankuat catchment (North Caucasus, Russia) were monitored intensively during the 2017 ablation season.

summary:  This study was undertaken in the 9.1 km² glacierized catchment of the Djankuat River located in the Northern Caucasus.  The main goal of our studywas to assess the impact of an exceptional erosion event on 1st July 2015 (with an annual exceedance probability of less than 0.1%) on suspended sediment yields and the relative contributions of various sediment sources.
